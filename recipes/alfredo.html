                        <p>The absolute best Alfredo sauce. You do not want to use a grated parmesan that you buy on a
                            shelf.
                            When
                            you
                            cook
                            with that type, your Alfredo goes from a sauce to a gooey mess. You want to buy a very good
                            and very
                            hard
                            parmesan in triangle form. Also, make sure the cream doesn't boil too much or there will not
                            be
                            enough
                            liquid to
                            make the Alfredo sauce smooth.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettucine pasta and cook for 8
                            to
                            10
                            minutes or
                            until al dente; drain.</li>
                        <li>In a large skillet melt the butter and add the chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5
                            minutes,
                            stirring
                            often, making sure not to burn the garlic.</li>
                        <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of the heavy cream into a small bowl. Add the egg yolk and beat
                            together; put
                            aside.
                            Pour the remaining cream into the frying pan. Increase the heat to medium-high. As the
                            cream
                            starts
                            to
                            boil,
                            mix rapidly using a whisk. Slowly add the cream/egg mixture. You do not want the egg to
                            curdle.
                            Continue
                            whisking until well blended.</li>
                        <li>Add 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese and continue to mix the cream. Pour in the remaining
                            Parmesan and
                            the
                            parsley, mix until smooth. Immediately remove from stove. Serve over cooked pasta.</li>
